# Uber Trip Analysis using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale Uber trip data from New York City to understand travel patterns and predict future ride demand. The analysis applies data science and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights such as peak hours, busy days, and demand trends.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Collection & Loading**
   - Download and load raw Uber trip data
   - Data source: Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL Uber Trip Analysis.csv

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and handling missing values
   - Date-time conversion and feature engineering
   - Time-series data preparation

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analysis of trip patterns and trends
   - Identification of peak hours and busy days
   - Visualization of demand patterns

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creation of time-based features
   - Lag features for time-series analysis
   - Feature scaling and normalization

5. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of machine learning models
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation using appropriate metrics

6. **Results & Insights**
   - Analysis of model performance
   - Key findings and business implications
   - Visualization of predictions vs actuals

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
